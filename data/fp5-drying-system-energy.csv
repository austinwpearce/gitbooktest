Hay Dryer Without Gas Heating,NA,1600,0,100,0,3.72242,MJ/kg-water removed,11/6/2024,Reasonable values that align with Parker 1992 and Arinze 1996
Hay Dryer With Gas Heating,NA,2200,75,25,3.83875,1.27958,MJ/kg-water removed,11/6/2024,Reasonable values that align with Parker 1992 and Arinze 1996
Commercially Dried,Commercially dried by buyer,2000,98,2,4.55997,0.09306,MJ/kg-water removed,11/6/2024,"Off-farm default; ""average"" value"

,,,,,,,,,gas % - the percentage of energy derived from fuel (fuel oil #2) or gas (propane or natural gas) to run the grain drier
,,,,,,,,,electric % - the percentage of energy derived from electricity to run the grain drier
,,,,,,,,,"thermal efficiency BTU per lb h2o - the average energy efficiency of the drier, lower numbers mean more drying efficiency"
,,,,,,,,,"relative thermal efficiency - air drying is set to 1, and all other systems are given a relative value, unsure how this is utilized"
,,,,,,,,,"electrical usage kwh bu pct - Sanford does not know where this came from, but he is guessing it is using bad assumptions"
,,,,,,,,,"DROPPED Relative Thermal Efficiency, Electrical usage columns as they don't appear to be used and there is some doubt to accuracy"
